# Pothole Detection System using YOLOv8

This project aims to build a pothole detection system using YOLOv8 on a custom dataset. We have manually collected over 2000 pothole images, and the data annotation and augmentation are performed using Roboflow . The prepared dataset is then used to train a YOLOv8 model for detecting potholes.
